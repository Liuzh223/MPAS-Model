# MPAS-Urban (HKUST)

MPAS-Urban is a HKUST-modified version of the MPAS-Atmosphere core based on the official MPAS-Model v8.2.2 release. This branch extends the Noah-MP land surface scheme with the Single-Layer Urban Canopy Model (SLUCM) for urban climate applications.

## Main Features

- Based on the official MPAS-Model v8.2.2 atmosphere core.
- Adds SLUCM coupling to Noah-MP.
- Computes urban surface energy balance and urban canopy parameters through SLUCM.
- Provides additional diagnostics for urban surface variables in MPAS output.
- BEP/BEM is not coupled in this branch; SLUCM is the available urban canopy option.

## Static Geographical Data

The LCZ-based static geographical dataset for MPAS-Urban is provided as:

```text
mpas_cglc_lcz.tar.gz
```

Users should extract this dataset into the directory used by:

```text
config_geog_data_path
```

To use the LCZ-based land-use data during static interpolation, set the following option in `namelist.init_atmosphere`:

```text
config_landuse_data = 'CGLC_LCZ'
```

## Runtime Tables

Additional urban runtime tables are stored in:

```text
src/core_atmosphere/physics/custom_wrf_files/
```

The current custom urban tables are:

```text
URBPARM_UZE.TBL
URBPARM_LCZ.TBL
URBPARM.TBL
```

During compilation, the script:

```text
src/core_atmosphere/physics/install_custom_wrf_files.sh
```

copies these urban tables, together with:

```text
src/core_atmosphere/physics/physics_noahmp/parameters/NoahmpTable.TBL
```

into:

```text
src/core_atmosphere/physics/physics_wrf/files/
```

The standard MPAS build then links `*TBL` and `*DATA*` files from `physics_wrf/files/` to the top-level MPAS run directory.

## Enabling SLUCM

To run MPAS-Urban with SLUCM, enable urban physics in `namelist.atmosphere`:

```text
config_urban_physics = .true.
```

When `config_urban_physics = .true.`, SLUCM is used as the urban canopy scheme. When `config_urban_physics = .false.`, the model falls back to the standard Noah-MP land surface configuration without urban canopy processes.

## Initialization Notes

When creating initial conditions with `init_atmosphere_model`, users should ensure that the first atmospheric model level is high enough for the urban canopy parameters used in the simulation.

In particular, avoid the warning:

```text
Warning ZR : Mean Height Table + 2 m is larger than the 1st WRF level
```

This warning indicates that the mean building height specified by the urban parameter table, plus the 2 m diagnostic height, exceeds the height of the first atmospheric level. In that case, the lowest atmospheric level is too low for the prescribed urban canopy geometry, which can affect surface-layer exchange and SLUCM coupling.

Users should therefore check the local building-height parameters in `URBPARM*.TBL` and set the vertical grid in `namelist.init_atmosphere` so that the first atmospheric level is above `ZR + 2 m` for the local urban categories used in the domain.

## General Usage

Build and run instructions for the general MPAS framework and MPAS-Atmosphere core are unchanged from the official v8.2.2 release. Please refer to the official MPAS-Atmosphere user guide and documentation on the MPAS-Dev website for the standard workflow.

This repository documents the urban extensions on top of MPAS v8.2.2. Other model components and workflows follow the official MPAS distribution.
